Following are the major Problems that I faced during coding.

1) First and the most encountered error is "Assertion Error".
	Solution:
		 Then I check my variable type like int,float and str and it help me to involve avoiding the error.
		 Basically I was coming across this error because test file's value and my answer was not matching.

2) Sceond one is "indentation error".
	Solution:
		 I start using one method which is using four space before this I was using tab and four spaces both.

3) Third one is "Autograder".
	Solution:
		 I just can understand how actually autograder works..According to be it follow keenly the student test file and contains many checks.
		 Student who got clever mind deal it with hard Coding but mainly students including me couldn't get it.

4) Fourth one is "Syntax error".
	Solution:
		 Sir as you told to check flow of function and dry run the code ,this technique help me to resolve this error and 
		 involve my coding alot.

5) Fiveth one is "NameError".

6) Sixth one is "TypeError".

       Last two Error I met very less.I hope these all Error will not in my codes next time as Sir you delared them clearly and
	nicely in the class and I am try hard to get them over.
